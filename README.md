# DialogueEditor
Simple dialogue editor

This was programmed using C#7.2 , and uses some exclusive features(like local functions).
If you wish to use it in a pre-C#7.2 environment, you will have to move the local functions outside to the class.

-- Usage is simple --

Right click on Project Panel --> Create --> Dialogue to create a dialogue for an NPC.

Windows --> Open Dialogue editor to open the editor.

Drag Middle Mouse button to navigate in editor, Right click to open menus
